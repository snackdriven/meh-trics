# Complete Biome-Only Setup Checklist âœ…

## What's Already Done

### âœ… Dependencies & Package Management
- [x] Removed all ESLint/Prettier dependencies from all `package.json` files
- [x] Added `@biomejs/biome` to root devDependencies
- [x] Created `.npmrc` to prevent `package-lock.json` generation
- [x] Deleted existing `package-lock.json` file

### âœ… Configuration Files
- [x] Created comprehensive `biome.json` configuration
- [x] Removed all `.eslintrc*` and `.prettierrc*` files
- [x] Updated `.gitignore` to block linter config files
- [x] Created VS Code settings in `.vscode/settings.json`
- [x] Created VS Code extension recommendations

### âœ… Scripts & Prevention
- [x] Added Biome scripts to all `package.json` files (`lint`, `format`, `check`, etc.)
- [x] Created robust prevention script at `scripts/prevent-linters.js`
- [x] Added preinstall hook to block ESLint/Prettier installations
- [x] Created validation script at `scripts/validate-biome-setup.js`
- [x] Created setup guidance script at `scripts/setup-biome.js`

### âœ… Documentation
- [x] Created comprehensive guide at `docs/BIOME_SETUP.md`
- [x] Added troubleshooting section
- [x] Documented all prevention mechanisms

## What You Still Need to Do

### ðŸ”§ One-Time Setup (Do This Now)

1. **Install Biome VS Code Extension**:
   ```bash
   code --install-extension biomejs.biome
   ```
   Or manually: Command Palette â†’ Extensions: Install Extensions â†’ Search "Biome"

2. **Restart VS Code** to apply all settings

3. **Test the setup**:
   ```bash
   bun run check       # Should show linting/formatting issues
   bun run format      # Should format your code
   bun run lint:fix    # Should fix linting issues
   ```

### ðŸš¨ Prevent Future Issues

The following mechanisms are **already active** to prevent accidental linter installations:

1. **Preinstall Script**: Blocks ESLint/Prettier during `bun install`
2. **Package Validation**: Scans all package.json files for blocked dependencies
3. **Git Ignore**: Prevents committing linter config files
4. **VS Code Settings**: Disables other formatters when Biome extension is installed

## Available Commands

From any directory in your workspace:

```bash
# Linting
bun run lint          # Check for linting issues
bun run lint:fix      # Fix linting issues automatically

# Formatting  
bun run format        # Format all code

# Combined (recommended)
bun run check         # Check both linting and formatting
bun run check:fix     # Fix both linting and formatting
```

## Validation

Run this anytime to check your setup:

```bash
node scripts/validate-biome-setup.js
```

## If Someone Accidentally Installs ESLint/Prettier

**Don't panic!** The prevention mechanisms will catch this, but if it happens:

1. **Remove the packages**:
   ```bash
   bun remove eslint prettier @typescript-eslint/parser
   cd frontend && bun remove eslint prettier
   cd ../backend && bun remove eslint prettier
   ```

2. **Delete any config files**:
   ```bash
   rm -f .eslintrc* .prettierrc* prettier.config.* eslint.config.*
   ```

3. **Run cleanup**:
   ```bash
   bun run check:fix
   node scripts/validate-biome-setup.js
   ```

## Project-Wide Benefits

âœ… **Performance**: Biome is significantly faster than ESLint + Prettier  
âœ… **Simplicity**: One tool instead of multiple with conflicting configs  
âœ… **Consistency**: No more formatter wars or configuration conflicts  
âœ… **Modern**: Built in Rust with TypeScript-first approach  
âœ… **Maintenance**: Fewer dependencies to manage and update  

## Summary

Your project is now **100% configured** for Biome-only linting and formatting with **multiple prevention layers** to stop other linters from being installed. The only remaining step is installing the VS Code extension and testing!
