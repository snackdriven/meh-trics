### 4. **SettingsPageOptimized.tsx**
**Location:** `frontend/components/SettingsPageOptimized.tsx`

**Major Optimizations Applied:**
- ‚úÖ **React.memo()** for the main component
- ‚úÖ **Extracted section components** (AccountSettingsSection, CustomizationSection, DataManagementSection)
- ‚úÖ **Memoized tab configuration** for performance
- ‚úÖ **Stable callback objects** to prevent child re-renders
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced accessibility** with proper tab navigation and ARIA attributes

**Performance Impact:**
- Each settings section only re-renders when its specific data changes
- Memoized sub-components prevent unnecessary updates
- Optimized dialog state management

**Note:** Some API integration issues remain due to backend client structure changes, but the optimization patterns are correctly implemented.

### 5. **TodayTasksOptimized.tsx** (Previously Completed)
**Location:** `frontend/components/TodayTasksOptimized.tsx`

**Status:** ‚úÖ Already optimized in previous phases
- Memoized component with stable callbacks
- Accessibility improvements
- Loading state optimization
- Task filtering and sorting optimization

## üîß Optimization Patterns Applied

### **Performance Patterns**
1. **React.memo()** - Applied to all main components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **useMemo()** - Used for expensive computations, filtered data, and stable object references
3. **useCallback()** - Used for stable function references to prevent child re-renders
4. **Component extraction** - Large components split into smaller, focused sub-components
5. **Stable references** - Objects and arrays memoized to prevent reference equality issues

### **Accessibility Patterns**
1. **ARIA labels and roles** - Comprehensive screen reader support
2. **Keyboard navigation** - All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
3. **Focus management** - Proper focus handling in dialogs and modals
4. **Screen reader announcements** - Live regions for dynamic content updates
5. **Semantic markup** - Proper HTML structure for assistive technology

### **Code Organization Patterns**
1. **Clear separation of concerns** - Logic separated from presentation
2. **Component extraction** - Reusable sub-components for better maintainability
3. **Consistent error handling** - Standardized error patterns across components
4. **Comprehensive documentation** - JSDoc comments explaining optimization patterns
5. **Type safety** - Proper TypeScript usage throughout
