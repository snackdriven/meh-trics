## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Install the Encore CLI which runs the local backend environment and ensure
[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is installed for managing dependencies (e.g. `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`):

```bash
# macOS
brew install encoredev/tap/encore
# Linux
curl -L https://encore.dev/install.sh | bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
iwr https://encore.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Installing Dependencies
This repository uses Bun workspaces for both the backend and frontend. Run the following once from the repository root:

```bash
bun install
```
Whenever you pull new changes that add dependencies, run `bun install` again to
ensure all workspaces are up to date.

### Running the Backend

```bash
cd backend
encore run
```

The API server will start and print a local URL (usually `http://localhost:4000`).
With the server running you can open `http://localhost:4000/metrics` to see
timings for recent API calls. See [docs/METRICS.md](docs/METRICS.md) for more
details.

### Running the Frontend

Install dependencies from the repository root (one time after cloning):

```bash
bun install
```

The frontend expects a `VITE_CLIENT_TARGET` environment variable pointing to the
backend API. Copy `.env.development` to `.env` if you need to customize the
value. By default it uses `http://localhost:4000`:

```bash
cp frontend/.env.development frontend/.env
```
Edit the new `.env` file and set `VITE_CLIENT_TARGET` to your backend URL.

Then start the development server from the root with:

```bash
bun run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next free port).

### Generating the Frontend Client

If you make changes to the backend API, regenerate the TypeScript client used by the frontend:

```bash
cd backend
encore gen client --target leap
```

## Development Workflow

### Creating a Backend Endpoint
1. Add a new `.ts` file inside `backend/task`, `backend/mood`, `backend/habits`, or `backend/calendar`.
2. Export a function annotated with `encore.service` to define the route.
3. Start the API server with `encore run` and verify the new endpoint.

### Regenerating the Frontend Client
After changing the API surface run:
```bash
cd backend
encore gen client --target leap
```
Commit the updated `frontend/client.ts` file.

### Updating the Frontend
Import the generated client in your React components:
```ts
import backend from "~backend/client";
const result = await backend.task.yourEndpoint(params);
// or backend.habits.yourEndpoint(params)
// or backend.calendar.yourEndpoint(params)
```
Use the result to update UI state.

### Importing Calendar Events
Upload an `.ics` file to import events into the calendar service:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: text/calendar" \
  --data-binary @my-events.ics \
  http://localhost:4000/calendar-events/import
```

The endpoint responds with a JSON object describing how many events were
imported and how many were skipped due to duplicates.

## SQL Linting & Standard Practices
- **Lint & format**: run `bun x biome check --apply .` before committing to automatically format files and sort imports.
- **Lint SQL**: execute `bun run lint:sql` to catch common SQL mistakes in migrations.
- **Check migrations**: run `bun run check:migrations` to ensure migration numbers aren't duplicated within a service.
- **Minimize migrations**: when iterating locally, update the latest migration file rather than creating a new one until the change is deployed. This keeps the history small and avoids unnecessary steps on new environments.
- **Run tests**: execute `bun run test` to make sure unit tests still pass. Run `bun install` beforehand to populate `node_modules`; missing dependencies will cause `vitest` to fail.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors like `column "archived_at" does not exist`, restart the
backend with `encore run` to apply any pending database migrations. Migrations
run automatically when the server starts, so be sure to restart after pulling
new changes.

## Deployment
Check `DEVELOPMENT.md` for detailed deployment instructions, including how to deploy to Encore Cloud or self‑host using Docker.

## Architecture Overview

The backend is organized around a collection of small "agents" that each own a domain of functionality:

- **TaskAgent** – tasks and scheduling logic
- **HabitAgent** – recurring habit tracking and streaks
- **MoodAgent** – mood check‑ins with notes
- **JournalAgent** – quick or freeform journal entries
- **TaggingAgent** – automatic context-aware tags
- **RoutineAgent** – recurring task templates
- **CalendarAgent** – aggregates entries into a calendar view
- **InsightAgent** – analyzes data for trends and suggestions

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for the full definitions. A more detailed walkthrough lives in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Development

To run both backend and frontend concurrently:

```sh
bun run dev:all
```

## Environment Variables

Configuration is managed via environment variables. You can use a `.env` file in the project root. Example variables:

```
# .env
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/mehtrics
ENCORE_CACHE_TTL=600
# ...other variables...
```

- `PORT`: Port for the backend server.
- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for your database.
- `ENCORE_CACHE_TTL`: (Optional) Cache time-to-live for Encore analytics endpoints.

## Docker / Self-Hosting Example

For self-hosting with Docker, provide environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` or Dockerfile:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  mehtrics-backend:
    image: your-backend-image
    environment:
      - PORT=3000
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@db:5432/mehtrics
      - ENCORE_CACHE_TTL=600
    # ...other config...
  mehtrics-frontend:
    image: your-frontend-image
    # ...other config...
```

## Encore Optimization

- **Caching:** Encore’s built-in caching can be enabled for analytics endpoints by using the `@cache` annotation or relevant Encore cache APIs.
- **Background Jobs:** For generating trends or heavy analytics, consider offloading to Encore background jobs for better performance and responsiveness
