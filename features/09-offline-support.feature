# Phase 1: Core Offline Functionality
# -----------------------------------

Feature: Offline Support
  As a user
  I want comprehensive offline functionality using modern web technologies
  So that I can maintain productivity even without internet connection

  # Basic Offline Functionality
  Scenario: Initial offline capability setup
    Given I first visit the app with internet connection
    When the app loads and caches essential resources
    Then I should be able to use core features when going offline

  Scenario: View cached data offline
    Given I have previously loaded tasks, habits, moods, and calendar data
    When I lose internet connection and continue using the app
    Then I should still be able to view all my existing data without limitations

  Scenario: Full feature access offline
    Given the app is running in offline mode
    When I navigate through different sections (tasks, habits, mood, calendar)
    Then all core functionality should remain available without degradation

  # Offline Data Creation and Modification
  Scenario: Create new entries offline
    Given I'm offline and want to stay productive
    When I create new tasks, log moods, update habits, and add calendar events
    Then all new entries should be saved locally and immediately usable

  Scenario: Edit existing data offline
    Given I have cached data and I'm offline
    When I modify existing tasks, update habit progress, or edit calendar events
    Then all changes should be saved locally and reflected in the UI

  Scenario: Delete data offline
    Given I need to remove outdated information while offline
    When I delete tasks, habits, or other entries
    Then the deletions should be processed locally and queued for server sync

  Scenario: Complex operations offline
    Given I'm offline and need to perform multi-step operations
    When I reorder tasks, bulk-update habits, or reschedule multiple calendar events
    Then all complex operations should work seamlessly offline

  # Offline Data Persistence and Storage
  Scenario: Persistent offline storage
    Given I make changes while offline
    When I close and reopen the app while still offline
    Then all my offline changes should persist and be available

  Scenario: Storage quota management
    Given I use the app extensively offline over time
    When local storage approaches browser limits
    Then the app should manage storage efficiently and warn about space constraints

  Scenario: Data compression and optimization
    Given I have large amounts of cached data
    When the app stores data offline
    Then storage should be optimized to minimize space usage while maintaining performance

  # Connection State Management
  Scenario: Connection status awareness
    Given I'm using the app in varying network conditions
    When my connection state changes (online/offline/poor connection)
    Then I should see clear, non-intrusive indicators of my current connection status

  Scenario: Graceful degradation for poor connections
    Given I have a weak or intermittent internet connection
    When the app detects poor connectivity
    Then it should automatically switch to offline mode to prevent data loss

  Scenario: Smart connection retry
    Given I'm in an area with intermittent connectivity
    When the app detects connection opportunities
    Then it should intelligently attempt sync without being overly aggressive

  # Progressive Web App (PWA) Integration
  Scenario: PWA installation and offline readiness
    Given I want to use the app like a native application
    When I install the PWA on my device
    Then it should work fully offline after installation with all features available

  Scenario: PWA update handling
    Given the app has been updated while I was offline
    When I come back online and the app detects updates
    Then I should be notified about updates and be able to apply them seamlessly

  Scenario: Background synchronization
    Given I have the PWA installed and make offline changes
    When I close the app and later regain connectivity
    Then background sync should handle data synchronization even when the app isn't open

# Phase 2: Synchronization, Conflict Resolution, and Analytics
# -----------------------------------------------------------

  # Online/Offline Synchronization
  Scenario: Automatic sync when connection restored
    Given I made multiple changes while offline
    When internet connection is restored
    Then all offline changes should automatically sync to the server in correct order

  Scenario: Incremental synchronization
    Given I have both offline changes and need to receive server updates
    When synchronization begins
    Then only changed data should sync, minimizing bandwidth and time

  Scenario: Sync progress indication
    Given synchronization is in progress after being offline
    When I'm watching the sync process
    Then I should see clear progress indicators and know which items are syncing

  Scenario: Sync error handling and retry
    Given sync attempts fail due to network issues or server problems
    When sync errors occur
    Then the app should retry intelligently and queue failed items for later attempts

  # Conflict Resolution
  Scenario: Simple conflict resolution
    Given I changed a task offline and someone else changed the same task online
    When synchronization detects the conflict
    Then I should see both versions and be able to choose which to keep

  Scenario: Complex conflict resolution
    Given multiple conflicting changes across different data types
    When comprehensive conflicts need resolution
    Then I should get a conflict resolution interface showing all conflicts clearly

  Scenario: Automatic conflict resolution
    Given I have set preferences for handling certain types of conflicts
    When simple conflicts occur that match my preferences
    Then they should be resolved automatically according to my rules

  Scenario: Conflict prevention strategies
    Given I want to minimize conflicts in team/shared environments
    When I work offline with shared data
    Then the system should use timestamp and user-based strategies to prevent conflicts

  # Offline Analytics and Insights
  Scenario: Offline analytics calculation
    Given I have cached historical data and make new entries offline
    When I view analytics and insights while offline
    Then calculations should work with available data and update when online

  Scenario: Offline export capabilities
    Given I need to export data while offline
    When I request data export (CSV, PDF, etc.)
    Then exports should work with locally available data

# Phase 3: Advanced Offline Features, Optimization, and Collaboration
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Advanced Offline Features
  Scenario: Offline search functionality
    Given I have cached data and I'm offline
    When I search across tasks, habits, moods, and journal entries
    Then search should work fully on cached data with full-text capabilities

  Scenario: Offline filtering and sorting
    Given I want to organize my data while offline
    When I apply filters, sorts, and groupings to any data type
    Then all organizational features should work on cached data

  Scenario: Offline calendar integration
    Given I have calendar events cached and I'm offline
    When I view calendar in different formats (month, week, day)
    Then all calendar functionality should work with cached events

  # Offline Performance Optimization
  Scenario: Fast offline startup
    Given I frequently use the app offline
    When I open the app without internet connection
    Then it should start quickly and feel as responsive as when online

  Scenario: Offline memory management
    Given I use the app extensively offline over long periods
    When memory usage becomes significant
    Then the app should manage memory efficiently without degrading performance

  # Offline Collaboration and Sharing
  Scenario: Offline preparation for sharing
    Given I want to share data later when online
    When I prepare exports or sharing links while offline
    Then sharing preparation should work and execute when connectivity returns

  Scenario: Offline team coordination
    Given I work with team members who may also be offline
    When we all make changes offline and later sync
    Then the system should handle multi-user offline scenarios gracefully

  # Emergency and Edge Cases
  Scenario: Extended offline periods
    Given I may be offline for days or weeks (travel, remote areas)
    When I use the app for extended periods without connectivity
    Then it should remain fully functional with appropriate storage and performance management

  Scenario: Offline data corruption recovery
    Given local data becomes corrupted while offline
    When the app detects data integrity issues
    Then it should have recovery mechanisms and maintain data safety

  Scenario: Offline storage cleanup
    Given I accumulate significant offline data over time
    When storage needs optimization
    Then I should have tools to clean up old cached data while preserving important offline capabilities
