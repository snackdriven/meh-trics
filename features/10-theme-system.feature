  Then changes should apply instantly without affecting app responsiveness

Scenario: Theme caching and optimization
  Given I use complex custom themes
  When the app loads with my theme settings
  Then theme application should be optimized to minimize loading time

# Integration with System Settings
Scenario: Operating system theme integration
  Given my OS automatically switches between light and dark modes
  When the system theme changes
  Then the app should automatically follow the system preference unless I've overridden it

Scenario: Browser preference respect
